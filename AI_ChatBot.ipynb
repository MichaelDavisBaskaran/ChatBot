\"Potential complications may include:\\n\\nFluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema)\\n\\nA sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's ability to function and may be life-threatening\\n\\nHeart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease\\n\\nWeak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures\\n\\nAnemia\\n\\nDecreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility\\n\\nDamage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty
